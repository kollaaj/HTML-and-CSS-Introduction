# HTML & CSS Introduction assignment

## Description

I created a one page website for a restaurant that does not exist (but dibs on the name if I ever go down that road) to exercise my new HTML and CSS skills. 
The minimum requirements for this assignment were followed to a tee

Minimum requirements:
- Websiteâ€™s body should contain at least 3 parts: header, main and footer element's
- header element should contain a logo and navigation item
- footer element should contain at least some contact information

Website should contain:
- At least 2 section elements
- Paragraph, list, image and anchor elements
- be styled with CSS
- color palette
- Google fonts
- Hover state for links

-Use BEM notation for the CSS (yeah not so much, I dont get BEM but I will... later)

This is the link to the surge static website that I managed to publish:
